SUMMARY
AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer with over 2 years of experience in computer vision and AI
projects. Skilled in developing innovative solutions, such as real-time traffic analysis and sports
analytics using YOLOv8, and enhancing AI systems with hierarchical clustering techniques. Proven
track record of leveraging AWS technologies for deploying AI applications. Expertise in transforming
complex datasets into actionable insights demonstrates a strong ability to deliver valuable
contributions, ready to elevate efficiency and accuracy for any forward-thinking organisation.
WORK EXPERIENCE
Data Scientist, Psi-Square, London, UK
04/2024 – 09/2025
Engineered a comprehensive computer vision project that calculates the traffic dwell duration in
zones for live video feeds. The key takeaway was the utilisation of system clocks for time-in and
time-out instead of incorporating FPS for live streams, complemented by Roboflow’s ByteTrack to
track multiple vehicles in the zones without incurring latency.
Investigated and conceived a project on football players and pitch detection, training a YOLOv8
model for the detection of players from both teams. Utilised UMAP for dimensionality reduction
which enhanced accuracy. For ball tracking in 2D, applied transformations based on key point
coordinates of the pitch, culminating in a game-like end product capable of detecting players and
ball possession.
Pioneered a Multi-Agent RAG leveraging langGraph for an academic research project. A
WebResearch Agent, PaperScraper Agent, and Evaluator Agent were employed to address user-
specified queries related to research papers. Should the Evaluator Agent deem results
inadequate, the WebResearch Agent was triggered to locate more suitable answers.

AI Engineer, OMNO AI, Lahore
05/2023 – 02/2024
Developed a vehicle speed estimation project employing a single camera sensor for a specified
highway. Live video was streamed through AWS Kinesis and AWS Lambda to skip frames and
synchronise with the FPS of a custom car detection model.
Applied transformation matrix techniques to convert 3D points into 2D, facilitating accurate speed
calculation.
Optimised RAG chunks by establishing hierarchical clusters that began from the base node and
chunks, enabling the calculation of embeddings between simultaneous chunks while descending
the tree structure. This significantly enhanced the relevance of the final customer bot's responses
to queries.
Achieved proficiency in deploying and scaling an AI ad creation application using AWS EC2
instances. Created a workflow for scraping brand websites to extract text and imagery details,
which were processed by an LLM Agent tailored to extract brand call-to-action (CTA) button text,
header text, and punchlines. Utilised generative AI to produce seamless ad banners in required
sizes using the specified text types.
Conceived a proof of concept for face authentication employing an NIR camera for depth
imaging, conducting an extensive research study on the implementation of PointNet++. The
primary objective was to replicate state-of-the-art smartphone unlocking techniques that utilise
NIR images to accurately identify facial features and match them with an embedding vector
containing user data.
